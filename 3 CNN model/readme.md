# This directory contains datails about RNN model. 

## Data preparation:
To prepare own training data. First download the raw data from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=11o_KP61tjHDA8X9s54wdOoYWci1ebK-6). Extract it into this directory. Then run `prepareData.py` to prepare your own training data.

## Model
The .ipynb notebook contains the details about the model. I have already included a little data to demonstrate the working of model. So, preparation of dataset is optional here.
