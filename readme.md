My proposal : [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1i2WemA85ZYj-pSh47vzmzsiWCNkdeZ3b](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1i2WemA85ZYj-pSh47vzmzsiWCNkdeZ3b)

This repository contains the code that I have prepared to demonstrate my approach towards the problem of **Detecting and classifying whales from Acoustic data**. These codes will complement my proposal.

Repository is divided into three parts. Each part has it's own **Ipython Notebook**. These .ipynb notebook contains all of the steps in detail. So, I recommend you to check them out.
