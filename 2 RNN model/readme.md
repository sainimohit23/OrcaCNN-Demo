## Preparation of dataset
To prepare your own dataset first download the raw audio files from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=11o_KP61tjHDA8X9s54wdOoYWci1ebK-6). Extract the data in this directory. Then run `prepareData.py` to create data for training the model.

## RNN model
The `Model_Details.ipynb` notebook has the details of RNN model. I have included a little sample data in this repository to demonstrate the working of model. So, previous step is completely optional.
